As ORDERED at the February 11 Conference: Plaintiffs' motion to compel OpenAI to produce discovery into Project Giraffe and additional deposition time of Mr. Monaco (ECF 1220)Plaintiffs were directed to email Chambers by Friday, February 13, 2026 to request the credentials to a secure site to upload the video footage of Mr. Monaco's 30(b)(1) and 30(b) (6) depositions. Defendants were directed to file under seal responses to Plaintiffs' questions regarding Project Giraffe by 11:59 PM on February 12, 2026. After reviewing Defendant's answers, Plaintiffs may file a new motion to compel by February 13, 2026, at 11:59 PM addressing any remaining document requests. The issue of Monaco's deposition will be resolved separately. Class Plaintiffs' motion seeking in camera review of the two clawed back and four redacted documents (ECF 1205). Plaintiffs' motion seeking in camera review is GRANTED. Microsoft has uploaded the documents for in camera review via the secure link from Chambers. Plaintiffs' motion for additional deposition time (exclusive of Monaco's deposition) (ECF 1216) The parties are directed to file a joint stipulation on their agreement on additional or reallocated deposition time by Friday, February 13, 2026, based on their representations in Court. Plaintiffs' motion seeking in camera review of OpenAI's privilege assertions over three categories of documents (ECF 1214) This motion is GRANTED. OpenAI is directed to file documents with accompanying summaries for in camera review by Tuesday, February 17, 2026. Plaintiffs' response is due Thursday, February 19, 2026. Parties are encouraged to meet and confer in advance of their filings to discuss any further downgrades of redactions. The parties' briefing for the March 10, 2026, case management conference is as follows: a. Initial briefs are due by March 3, 2026; b. Responsive briefs are due by March 5, 2026; and c. The parties are encouraged to work together, and may file a joint case management discovery report by March 5, 2026 in lieu of the briefs at (a) and (b). d. Defendants' briefs are limited to five pages each, and Plaintiffs' joint brief is limited to 10 pages total. Plaintiffs' motion for additional OpenAI discovery relating to "access settings" and "additional copies of pirated material" (ECF Nos. 869, 875, 946, 949, 993) The parties represented that the "access settings" dispute has been resolved. (Feb. 11, 2026 Hrg. Tr. at 79:11-15; ECF 1274-2 at 11-13). Plaintiffs identified a remaining dispute concerning the use of pirated material outside of training datasets, (Feb. 11, 2026 Hrg. Tr. at 79:18-19), while OpenAI said there is "no dispute' as to the materials from the "training data project," because they already agreed to produce any material from that project." Id. at 81:21-25. Plaintiffs claimed to have direct messages that supported discovery into OpenAI employees "going to shadow libraries to access material, we think if OpenAI employees are downloading it as part of their work, again, I don't think [OpenAI] contests that this was not as part of creating a training dataset." Id. at 82:12-15. OpenAI claimed that the briefing at ECF 869, "the original motion that began this whole process," was limited by its terms to "copyrighted books datasets." Id. at 84:1-4. The parties are directed to meet and confer regarding Plaintiffs' requests as articulated on pages 82-83 of the hearing transcript, and whether OpenAI will produce the requested discovery. If motion practice is necessary, Plaintiff must file a NEW motion to compel, designated as such, by February 18, 2026. Defendant's opposition is due February 20, 2026. The Court will consider apportioning costs under Rule 37(a)(5) if a motion to compel is necessary. Plaintiffs' motion for custom GPT metrics data on custom GPTs (ECF 1206); Plaintiffs' motion for Microsoft to produce output logs (ECF 1195); and OpenAI's motion for Tollbit data (ECF 1121) These motions are resolved for reasons stated on the record. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close the following ECF Nos. in Case No. 25- MD-3143: 1205, 1206, 1214, 1195, 1121, 1220.

All motions described herein that require supplemental briefing will not be heard at the February 11, 2026 conference. All supplemental briefs are limited to five pages. On January 22, the parties represented that the Class Plaintiffs' motions at ECF 1055 and 1132 were resolved. Yet two weeks later, the issue resurfaced in the joint chart (ECF 1274-2 at 6), where the parties seem to be arguing about document production related to Project Giraffe. There shall be no new litigation in the joint chart. The parties are directed to continue meeting and conferring on the NEW dispute and, if they cannot resolve the issue, they will file a NEW motion to compel on this specific issue that explains to the Court: what the parties previously agreed to; what Project Giraffe and Okapi-related data mean (and whether the Court should become familiar with other African mammals referenced in the production); and what discovery the parties seek or have agreed to (or dispute) about any production that Class (and/or News) Plaintiffs continue to seek. The motion is to be filed according to the following schedule: Plaintiffs' brief is due Friday, February 13, 2026 and Defendant's response is due February 20, 2026. There shall be no replies. The Court will consider the motion for additional deposition time for Mr. Monaco to be fully briefed and may ask questions at the February 11th conference, but does not expect to rule from the bench on this issue. (ECF 1220). This motion for total additional deposition time is DENIED. The Court will consider, however, requests for additional time beyond the parties' deposition protocol on a deposition-by- deposition basis, after a showing that such time is necessary. If Plaintiffs seek to make any such motions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 and 30, whether for additional deposition time for a witness already deposed, or for more time for a prospective witness, they must file a letter motion after a robust meet and confer. Each such motion must also include a chart that lists all the witnesses who have been deposed, the date(s) they were deposed, and the time spent for each deposition, as well as witnesses who have yet to be deposed, the number of hours currently allocated to each such witness, and the time remaining for each category and/or witness in light of the reallocation of time done in January.

All supplemental briefs are limited to five pages. I. Class Plaintiffs a. Microsoft Office Financials and the "January 2025 public document" (ECF 1000) The parties are directed to meet and confer in accordance with the Sedona Principles' recommendations to work cooperatively and clearly specify the ESI being sought. The Sedona Principles, Third Edition: Best Practices, Recommendations &amp; Principles for Addressing Electronic Document Production, 19 SEDONA CONF. J. 1 (2018). Specifically, the Court expects counsel to discuss whether Class Plaintiffs seek additional discovery in light of the "January 2025 public document" (ECF 1176-1), what form that discovery might take, whether the discovery sought is relevant and proportional under Rule 26(b), and whether, even if the discovery is relevant and proportional, the parties can reach a compromise that does not necessitate the filing of a motion to compel. IF further motion practice is necessary, the motions shall be filed on February 13, 2026, and February 16, 2026. b. Plaintiffs' motion to compel OpenAI to log outside counsel communications related to the deletion of Books 1 and Books 2 (ECF 1030) This motion is DENIED as moot in light of the parties' representation that they agree to await Judge Stein's ruling on the Rule 72 objection. (ECF 1176 at 4(a)). c. OpenAI's motion for a protective order regarding the scope of the "LibGen test file" deposition (ECF 1038) This motion is GRANTED without prejudice to further discovery regarding the acquisition of LibGen books or other pirated or torrented. The deposition referenced at ECF 1038 will be limited to the "nearly 100,000 LibGen books" that "were downloaded in September 2019." Dkt. 659 at 12. d. Plaintiffs' motion to compel OpenAI to produce documents and data related to regurgitation (ECF 1055) This motion is DENIED as moot, in light of the parties' resolution of the dispute. (ECF 1176 at 1(a)). e. Plaintiffs' motion to compel OpenAI to produce documents regarding the Disney-OpenAI agreement. (ECF 1077) Plaintiffs may file a motion to compel after meeting and conferring with OpenAI and considering the following issues: relevance with respect to the fair use factors, willfulness, burden, the existence of any protective orders, and the exhibits referenced in ECF 1080. If the parties are not able to resolve their dispute, they may file a new motion to compel on the following schedule: Plaintiffs' brief is due Friday, February 13, 2026 and Defendant's response is due February 20, 2026. There shall be no replies. II. News Plaintiffs a. The three additional implementations identified in the News Plaintiffs' motion for Microsoft GPT-4o discovery (ECF 1081) The parties are directed to submit supplemental briefing explaining: (1) any proposed or agreed-upon limitations on the discovery sought concerning the "three implementations"; (2) how the discovery sought satisfies the requirements of relevance and proportionality under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 26b; and (3) a description of the parties' meet and confer efforts. III. Ziff Davis a. Status of Ziff Davis's Requests Ziff Davis and OpenAI are directed to file a status letter on February 13, 2026 informing the Court as to what issues remain.
